\description{
The Elbow plot permits to identify a subset of top-$k$ objects. Objects are ordered according to their rank position shown on the x-axis. On the y-axis we have the corresponding estimated signal value of each object. The idea of the elbow plot is to scan for 'jumps' - neighbouring signal estimates which are visually much distant - in an exploratory manner. The elbowPlot function requires the estimation results from the estimateTheta function.
